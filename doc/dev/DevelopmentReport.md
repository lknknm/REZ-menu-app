## REZ Development Report (INF-0999)
Provided this is the Final Project of the training course in Microsoft technologies at the Institute of Computing at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), it is important that the students follow some base criteria about each subject taught during the course. For that reason, the following topics were considered during development:

- C# Programming Language and known software architecture patterns;
- Code versioning;
- Hosting;
- Project Management;
- User Experience;
- User Interface Programming;
- Safe Programming;

### Programming and Architecture Pattern
